# Communication is üîë

### Social media is the evolution of communication, and Emote is the evolution of social media. Technology has failed to adapt as communication has evolved, and Emojr is here to make up for that. Welcome to the new age of expressing yourself digitally. Welcome to Emote.

Emote is the Emoji-only social network. Once you've established an account under a unique (emoji-only) username, you will have access to a vibrant global community of interesting and diverse people, all expressing themselves through the power of emoji. With Emote, you can take advantage of the vast array of expressive and meaningful emoji characters to have your message heard. Your followers can react to your posts with emoji of their own, expressing exactly how they feel about your quality content.

### How Emote came to üêù

Emote was born in the ATL as a project for HackGSU. In under 36 hours (we took a break to build [these](http://devpost.com/software/1code-for-macy-s) we built a RESTful backend and a polished native iOS app and had a blast doing it.

### Who are we? üë¨

We are [James Risberg](http://jamesrisberg.xyz) and [Joseph Pecoraro](http://josephpecoraro.me/) and we build cool stuff (sometimes together).
