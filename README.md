# Communication is üîë

### Social media is the evolution of communication, and Emojr is the evolution of social media. Technology has failed to adapt as communication has evolved, and Emojr is here to make up for that. Welcome to the new age of expressing yourself digitally. Welcome to Emojr.

Emojr is the Emoji-only social network. Once you've established an account under a unique (emoji-only) username, you will have access to a vibrant global community of interesting and diverse people, all expressing themselves through the power of emoji. With Emojr, you can take advantage of the vast array of expressive and meaningful emoji characters to have your message heard. Your followers can react to your posts with emoji of their own, expressing exactly how they feel abotu your quality content.

### How Emojr came to üêù

Emojr was born in the ATL as a project for HackGSU. In under 36 hours (we took a break to build [these](http://devpost.com/software/1code-for-macy-s) we built a RESTful backend and a polished native iOS app and had a blast doing it.

### Does Emojr have a future? üôè

While the current product is nearly entirely shippable, there are some final touches in development before we feel comfortable releasing it to the wilds. We'll be releasing publicly or in semi-closed beta very soon ( < 1 Month ) and can't wait to elevate how you communicate!

### Who are we? üë¨

We are [James Risberg](http://jamesrisberg.xyz) and [Joseph Pecoraro](http://josephpecoraro.me/) and we build cool stuff (sometimes together).
